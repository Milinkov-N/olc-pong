## Todo

Although this game compiles and runs, it can be better!
I made up a little list of things than can be done to make
this cool game even cooler:

- Making score go beyond single digits ❌

- Get more use from virtual terminal sequences for better graphics ❌

- Main menu to choose difficulty (or speed of the ball) ❌

- Editable players names ❌

- Player nikname at the top ❌

- Table for best players ❌

- More pleasant gameover screen ❌
